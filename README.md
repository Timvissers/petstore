# Sample Application: Javascript Pet Store

This is a sample application for me to work with custom written Angular components: TODO smac
Using great Angular libraries is what you (should) do in your day to day job. This codebase is merely to bring my Angular knowledge to another level. Therefore, most of the functionality comes from custom written components: TODO SMAC
In TODO SMAC, simple, reusable and maintainable web components are written in Angular 1.4. These components are written in a way that should allow them to be easily upgraded for Angular 2.0.

A deployed version of these sources can be found here: https://javascriptpetstore.herokuapp.com/

Functionality is based on the Java Pet Store (Sun Microsystems)
